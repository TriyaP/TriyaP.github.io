		<h2>What people say - Reviews</h2>

		<p>La Fresca has become my go-to spot for elevating my coffee and pastry experience. The baristas clearly know their craft, and my cappuccino was a work of art, perfectly complementing the sweetness of the blueberry muffin. It's a little slice of Paris right here in Madison, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone seeking a delightful escape into a world of culinary perfection.</p>

		<p>As a self-proclaimed foodie, I'm always on the lookout for places that offer a perfect blend of taste and ambiance, and this place exceeded my expectations. The croissants are perfectly flaky, the macarons are a burst of flavor, and the cakes are simply divine. Pair that with their expertly crafted coffee, and you have a match made in culinary heaven.</p>

		<p> I recently celebrated my birthday here with a group of friends, and it was an absolute delight. The staff went above and beyond to make our celebration special, surprising me with a beautifully decorated cake that tasted as heavenly as it looked. It's a place that exudes charm and hospitality, making every visit a memorable experience.</p>

		<p>I recently moved to Madison and discovered La Fresca while exploring my new neighborhood. It has quickly become my favorite spot.  I've made it a mission to try everything on the menu. The almond croissants are a personal favorite, and the fruit tarts are like a burst of sunshine on a plate.</p>
